Medical provider fraud is a serious issue that costs the healthcare industry billions of dollars every year. Fraudulent activities can include billing for services that were not provided, performing unnecessary medical procedures, or using fake patient information. Detecting these fraudulent activities can be difficult, but with the help of data science and Machine Learning, it is possible to identify patterns and anomalies that can indicate fraud.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 

The goal of this project is to " predict the potentially fraudulent providers " based on the claims filed by them.

# DATA

We are considering Inpatient claims, Outpatient claims and Beneficiary details of each provider:
A) Inpatient Data
This data provides insights about the claims filed for those patients who are admitted in the hospitals. It also provides additional details like their admission and discharge dates and admit diagnosis code.
B) Outpatient Data
This data provides details about the claims filed for those patients who visit hospitals and not admitted in it.
C) Beneficiary Details Data
This data contains beneficiary KYC details like health conditions, region they belong to etc.
